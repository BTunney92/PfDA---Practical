# Assignment: Programming for Data Analysis

Author: Brendan Tunney

Student ID - G00270683

### Problem statement

The following assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python [2]. You are
required to create a Jupyter [5] notebook explaining the use of the package, including
detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.
There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook.

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.

2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.

3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.

4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

### How to run

To run the program, you will first need to have Anaconda installed on your device. It can be downloaded at the below link;

https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html

Once installed, open a juptyer notebook and open Numpy.ipynb file.

Click ''Kernal'' on the menu and then ''Restart Kernel and Run All''.
